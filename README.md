# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Introduction

Using the Amazin datasets we be analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

We will be selecting one of the datasets available and perform the following :- 

1) Load the data into an AWS RDS and query the data loaded using Postgres.
2) Use Pyspark to determine if there is any bias for favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
3) Write a written summary of the findings

## Deliverable 1 - Load the data into an AWS RDS and query the data loaded.

### Overview
